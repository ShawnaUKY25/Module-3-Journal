# Module 3 Self Reflections

# Week 4 – Searching with Grep
This week was a lot easier for me, but I still need to listen and what the lectures a few times to get my bearings, before practicing the exercises.

When I went to export the Scops.bib file, I only exported the first 10, and not the 100 that were available for my search. So, I had to do that over. There were also a few times I had to double check the accuracy of my entries. Because I received an error message. 
It feels like you need the patience of a saint to do this work. 
When things did work, I was relieved. 

My favorite outputs are the ones that sorted and counted. 

# Week 5 –  Managing Software and Library Search
I’m glad we learned how to update the system, but it took a few tries to realize that I had to enter the “sudo apt upgrade command”, followed by the “y” for yes. I must say, it’s a bit overwhelming to see all of the text populate so quickly. I’m still not sure what information is relevant, and what is standard.

*Using Yaz*
Installing yaz went well. I was able to do the basic search commands with relative ease. 
Things got a little more complicated with json. So, I stepped away and tried again the next day.

I had to revisit the lecture a few times to get a better understanding of the steps. When I rewatched the more advanced search steps started to click. 

I also began to wonder what happens when you find an error? Can you ask yaz for the record? If so, how? It seems a shame to notice an error and not do anything about it.

The biggest take away this week, make time for multiple reviews of the reading, lecture and exercises. I am more confident about the quality of my output because I have a better understanding about what I am doing and why.

# Recommended Grade:  A

*Rationale*
I understood what to expect in this module. It turns out, I need to rewatch the lectures a few times, in order for the content to really sink in. The activities help reinforce what I am learning.
